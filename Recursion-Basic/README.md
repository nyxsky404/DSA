# Recursion Implementations

This directory contains various recursion problems and their solutions.

## Implemented Problems

1. Basic Problems

   - Factorial
   - Fibonacci
   - Sum of digits
   - Power calculation

2. Functional Approach

   - Pure recursive functions
   - Return value based recursion
   - Base case handling

3. Parameterized Approach
   - State passing through parameters
   - Accumulator pattern
   - Tail recursion

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- Varies by problem
- Typically O(2^n) for basic recursion
- O(n) for optimized solutions

### Space Complexity

- O(n) for call stack
- O(1) for tail recursion
