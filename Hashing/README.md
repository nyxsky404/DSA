# Hashing Implementations

This directory contains implementations of hash tables and related problems.

## Implemented Features

1. Dictionary Implementation

   - Key-Value pair storage
   - Collision handling
   - Dynamic resizing

2. List-based Hashing
   - Simple hash table
   - Chaining implementation
   - Open addressing

## Complexity Analysis

### Dictionary Operations

- Insert: O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Search: O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Delete: O(1) average, O(n) worst

### Space Complexity

- O(n) for hash table storage
- Additional O(n) for chaining
