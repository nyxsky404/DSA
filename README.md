# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. The solutions are organized by topics:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Hashing
- Sorting Algorithms
- Stack & Queue
- Recursion
- Time & Space Complexity
- OOPS Concepts

Each topic contains multiple problems with their solutions in Python.

## Topics Covered

### Arrays

- Basic array operations
- Edge cases handling
- Common array problems

### Linked Lists

- Basic operations
- Cycle detection (Floyd's Algorithm)
- Middle element finding

- Nth node from end

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Stack & Queue

- Implementation
- Valid Parentheses
- Queue using Stack
- Stack using Queue
- Deque operations

### Recursion

- Basic problems
- Functional approach
- Parameterized approach

### Hashing

- Dictionary implementation
- List-based hashing

### OOPS

- Basic object-oriented programming concepts

## Usage
